chunk1.wav: the question I want to ask and answer is this why do we work
chunk2.wav: why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning instead of living Our Lives just filled
chunk3.wav: with bouncing from one Ted like Adventure when other
chunk4.wav: now I know if we have to make a living but nobody in this room think that's the answer to the question why do we work for folks in this room the work we do is challenging it's engaging it's stimulated it's meaningful and it for love
chunk5.wav: so we want to work and we didn't get paid but that's not why we do what we do and in general I think we think that material rewards are pretty bad reason for doing the work that we do when we
chunk6.wav: see if somebody that he's in it for the money
chunk7.wav: we are not just being the script
chunk8.wav: no I think this is totally obvious but the very obvious in this of it raises what is for me an incredibly profound question
chunk9.wav: why is this is so obvious why is
chunk10.wav: the for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet
chunk11.wav: the work they do has none of the characteristics that get us up and out of bed and off to win the office every morning how is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet to do work
chunk12.wav: that is monotonous meaningless and sold it
chunk13.wav: why is that as capitalism developed it created a mode of production of goods and services in which all the non-material satisfactions that might come from where
chunk14.wav: World lemonade
chunk15.wav: workers who do this kind of work when are they doing in factories in call centers or in fulfillment warehouses doing from pay
chunk16.wav: there's certainly no other Earthly reason to do what they do except for pay
chunk17.wav: so the question is why
chunk18.wav: and here's the answer
chunk19.wav: the answer is technology
chunk20.wav: now I know I know Yeah Yeah Yeahs technology automation screws people blah blah but not what I mean
chunk21.wav: I'm not talking about the kind of technology that is involved our lives and that people come to Ted to hear about I'm not talking about the technology of things profound vote that is
chunk22.wav: I'm talking about another technology I'm talking about the technology of ideas
chunk23.wav: I call it idea technology how clever of me
chunk24.wav: in addition to creating things science creates ideas science creates ways of understand
chunk25.wav: and in the social sciences the ways of understanding the get created or ways of understand
chunk26.wav: if you think your poverty is God's will you pray
chunk27.wav: if you think your poverty is the result of your on your own and adequacy you you shrink into into Despair and if you think your poverty is there
chunk28.wav: whether your response to Poverty is resignation or revolution depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty this is the role that ideas play in shaping our us as a human being then this is why idea technology may be the most profound
chunk29.wav: and there's something special about idea tech knowledge
chunk30.wav: that makes it different from the technology of things with things if the technology sucks
chunk31.wav: it just vanish
chunk32.wav: right bad technology disappears with ideas
chunk33.wav: false ideas about human beings will not go away if people believe that they are true
chunk34.wav: because of people believe that they are true they create ways of living and institutions that are consistent with his very false idea
chunk35.wav: and that's how the Industrial Revolution created a factory system in which
chunk36.wav: there was really nothing you can possibly get out of your day's work except for the pay at the end of the day because the father one of the fathers of the Industrial Revolution Adam Smith
chunk37.wav: show the work example is merely an example of how Falls ID
chunk38.wav: can create a circumstance that ends up making them true
chunk39.wav: it is not true that you just can't get good help anymore
chunk40.wav: it is true that you can't get good help anymore when you give people work to do that is the meaning and solace
chunk41.wav: an interesting Lee enough items with the same guy who gave us this incredible invention of mass production and division of labor under
chunk42.wav: of people who work in the assembly line for men who work at assembly line she said she generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become
chunk43.wav: no notice the word he was become
chunk44.wav: generally become as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become weather he intended it or not what Adam Smith was telling us to there is that the very shape of the institution within which people work creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution and deprives people of the opportunity to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for Grand
chunk45.wav: Sing About Me
chunk46.wav: can have complete confidence the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories
chunk47.wav: it's going to work the same damn way no matter what. We have about the cosmos

chunk53.wav: but we do have to worry about
chunk54.wav: the series we have a human nature
chunk55.wav: because human nature will be changed by the theories we have that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings the distinguished Anthropologist Clifford geertz said
chunk56.wav: and what he meant by that was that it is only Human Nature
chunk57.wav: to have a human nature that is very much the product of the society in which people live
chunk58.wav: vacuum in nature that is to say our human nature is much war created
chunk59.wav: manatees discovered
chunk60.wav: we design Human Nature by designing the institutions within which people live and work
chunk61.wav: in so you people
chunk62.wav: pretty much the closest I ever get to being with Masters of the Universe you people should be asking yourself
chunk63.wav: a question as you go back home to run your organization
